# Morphic Programming: A First Principles Manual for Agentic AI

By Nicola Sahar

## What is this?

A free manual on first principles for building useful AI systems with CLI agents like Claude Code.

Inspired by [Andrej Karpathy's tweet](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1872367336954536383) about there being "no manual" for this new programming paradigm.

## Read the Manual

**[morphic_programming_manual_v1.md](./morphic_programming_manual_v1.md)**

## What's Covered

**9 First Principles:**
1. Morphability - natural language as morphable code
2. Abstraction - tasks become reusable commands
3. Recursion - stack abstractions for leverage
4. Internal Consistency - prevent system drift
5. Reproducibility - crash-resilient design
6. Morphic Complexity - recognize over-engineering
7. E2E Autonomy - measure actual capabilities
8. Token Efficiency - maximize work per token
9. Mutation & Exploration - controlled self-improvement

**Plus:**
- System design (repo structure, git, context engineering)
- Practical tips and psychology
- Example commands you can use

## About the Author

I founded and sold [Semantic Health](https://betakit.com/semantic-health-acquired-by-us-based-medical-documentation-firm-aapc/), an AI healthcare startup. Now exploring AI for consciousness and mental health.

## Coming Soon

- More principles and advanced topics
- A compressed version of the first principles you can add as system context in your own morphic system
